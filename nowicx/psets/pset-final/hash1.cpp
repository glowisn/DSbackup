/// 
/// Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use 
/// a special function called the Hash function which is used to map 
/// a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. 
/// The efficiency of mapping depends of the efficiency of the hash 
/// function used.
///
/// Thus we can say that hashing is implemented using two steps as mentioned below:
/// 1) The value is converted into a unique integer key or hash by using a hash 
/// function. It is used as an index to store the original element, which falls 
/// into the hash table.
/// 2) The element from the data array is stored in the hash table where it can 
/// be quickly retrieved using the hashed key.In the above diagram, we saw that 
/// we have stored all the elements in the hash table after computing their 
/// respective locations using a hash function. We can use the following expressions 
/// to retrieve hash values and index.
///     hash = hash_func(key)
///     index = hash % table_size
/// 
/// Hash Function
/// A hash function basically should fulfill the following requirements:
/// Easy to Compute: A hash function, should be easy to compute the unique keys.
/// Less Collision : When elements equate to the same key values, there occurs 
/// a collision.There should be minimum collisions as far as possible in the 
/// hash function that is used.As collisions are bound to occur, we have to 
/// use appropriate collision resolution techniques to take care of the collisions.
/// Uniform Distribution : Hash function should result in a uniform distribution 
/// of data across the hash tableand thereby prevent clustering
/// 
/// Hash Table
/// Hash table or a hash map is a data structure that stores pointers to the 
/// elements of the original data array.
/// Having entries in the hash table makes it easier to search for a particular 
/// element in the array. the hash table uses a hash function to compute the index 
/// into the array of buckets or slots using which the desired value can be found.
/// 
/// Collision
/// In the case of hashing, even if we have a hash table of very large size then 
/// a collision is bound to be there. This is because we find a small unique 
/// value for a large key in general, hence it is completely possible for one 
/// or more value to have the same hash code at any given time.
/// 
/// Given that a collision is inevitable in hashing, we should always look for 
/// ways to prevent or resolve the collision. There are various collision 
/// resolution techniques that we can employ to resolve the collision occurring 
/// during hashing.
/// 
/// Collision Resolution Techniques
/// 1) Separate Chaining (Open Hashing)
/// This is the most common collision resolution technique. This is also known 
/// as open hashing and is implemented using a linked list.
/// each entry in the hash table is a linked list. When the key matches the hash 
/// code, it is entered into a list corresponding to that particular hash code. 
/// Thus when two keys have the same hash code, then both the entries are entered 
/// into the linked list.
/// The worst-case for separate chaining is when all the keys equate to the same 
/// hash code and thus are inserted in one linked list only. Hence, we need to 
/// look up for all the entries in the hash table and the cost which are 
/// proportional to the number of keys in the table.
/// 
/// Linear Probing (Open Addressing/Closed Hashing)
/// all the entry records are stored in the hash table itself. When key-value maps 
/// to a hash code and the position pointed to by hash code is unoccupied, then 
/// the key value is inserted at that location. If the position is already occupied, 
/// then using a probing sequence the key value is inserted in the next position 
/// which is unoccupied in the hash table.
/// Linear probing may suffer from the problem of ¡°Primary Clustering¡± in which there 
/// is a chance that the continuous cells may get occupied and the probability of 
/// inserting a new element gets reduced.
/// 
/// The following implementation is for hashing using the linked lists 
/// as a data structure for the hash table. We also use ¡°Chaining¡± 
/// as a collision resolution technique in this implementation.
